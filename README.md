To the MS Admission Committee,

I am pleased to write this Letter of Recommendation for Abhishek Jha, a former student in the B.Tech Mathematics and Computing program at Delhi Technological University (DTU), where he completed his undergraduate studies between 2018 and 2022.

I had the privilege of teaching Abhishek in the Operations Research course during his third year at DTU and have known him for over a year as his professor. In this subject, Abhishek demonstrated a keen understanding of complex mathematical concepts and their practical applications. His analytical approach to problem-solving and ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world situations were particularly impressive. He excelled in this course and consistently demonstrated his passion for mathematics and computing.

Abhishek’s academic foundation includes subjects such as Linear Algebra, Modern Algebra, Cryptography & Network Security, Graph Theory, Operating Systems, and Database Management System. His ability to quickly grasp complex concepts and apply them effectively in assignments and projects sets him apart from his peers. While Abhishek initially showed a tendency to delve deeply into theoretical aspects, he quickly adapted by integrating practical applications into his work, demonstrating his willingness to learn and grow. In particular, his final year project on Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms and Feature Selection Techniques was a testament to his research capabilities and deep understanding of data-related concepts. The project involved implementing machine learning algorithms to detect network intrusions, combined with feature selection techniques to improve the efficiency of detection models. Throughout this project, Abhishek displayed exceptional independence, managing every stage with minimal guidance while clearly articulating his progress during presentations.

Given his solid academic background, enthusiasm for mathematics and computer science subjects, and leadership potential, I am confident that Abhishek will excel in graduate studies and make meaningful contributions to your program. As someone who has closely observed his intellectual growth and perseverance, I strongly recommend him for the Master’s program at your esteemed university, as I believe he has the capability to thrive in an intellectually challenging environment.

Sincerely,
Dr. Laxminaryan Das
